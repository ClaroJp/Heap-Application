# Task Priority Manager

This is a simple Java console application that helps manage tasks based on priority. It uses a Min-Heap data structure to ensure that tasks with the highest priority (lowest number) are handled first.

## Features
1. Add tasks with a description and priority.
2. View the next task to complete.
3. Mark tasks as completed.
4. View all remaining tasks.

## Why I Made This
I made this application to solve a common problem: managing tasks efficiently based on their importance. Often, itâ€™s easy to get overwhelmed by multiple tasks, and I wanted a simple tool to prioritize them and ensure the most urgent ones are addressed first.
