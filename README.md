# Task Priority Manager

This is a simple Java console application that helps manage tasks based on priority. It uses a Min-Heap data structure to ensure that tasks with the highest priority (lowest number) are handled first.

## Features
1. Add tasks with a description and priority.
2. View the next task to complete.
3. Mark tasks as completed.
4. View all remaining tasks.

## Why I Made This
I created this program to practice using the Heap data structure and to make a simple tool that organizes tasks efficiently. It helps me understand how heaps work while providing a basic utility for task management. This program is a beginner project and is open for improvements. Feel free to fork and modify!
